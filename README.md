## Hello!
If you're here, you should be an HR-manager. :)


Here I load some files/projects/miniprojects to prove my analytical hard-skills (now junior-level). 
Also you can find SPSS-project (made during studying in MSU) and task in Excel Pivot Tables marathon (Sep 2021).


In my job as Data Analyst I use: Python (+pandas, numpy, seaborn etc) in Jupyter Notebook environment, SQL (Clickhouse, previously worked in Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL databases), used Redash service during studying. Tableau will be studied. I have experience in working with Excel pivot tables (and little experience in VBA on my last job).

You can see my project in Web Development here https://github.com/IBN93/project_mymoscow_Baryshnikov.git  
(HTML, CSS(Bootstrap), SCSS, JS(+jQuery), PHP, SQL(MySQL are used).
